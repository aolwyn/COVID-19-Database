# COVID-19-Database
An interactive website that allows people to find vaccination sites, find patients, search for vaccination status, and find doctors. Uses HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. Uses PHP to connect to the pre-existing database, developed using sql. 

## TO USE
- To use, download all required files. 
- download the covidDB.txt and upload to SQL server (create the database.)
- From there, you should be able to run the html and associated files. Make sure the files can be found in the correct directories.

## Preliminary Work
Some preliminary relational diagrams and an ER diagram can be found in the subfolder. 
NOTE: they are NOT the final product.

## Demonstration (incomplete)
The following YouTube link will run through an early demonstration of the website's features and functions.
